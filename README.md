# NoSQL-challenge


Welcome to my NoSQL-challenge!

This exercise was a dive into using MongoDB and incorporating the software into Python.  This challenge was relatively simple, but it still showcased the versatility of Python and its ability to seamlessly use different modules to handle extremely large quantities of data with easy.  

With large amounts of data, comes the challenge of sifting through and isolating the information you want, and this is one easy way of solving that problem.

Thank you for looking at my work!
